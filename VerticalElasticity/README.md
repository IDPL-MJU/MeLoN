# Employing Vertical Elasticity for Efficient Big Data Processing in Container-Based Cloud Environments

## This is source code repository for Adaptive Resource Management Scheme in Container-based Cloud Environments
Our adaptive resource management scheme can periodically monitor the resource usage patterns of running containers and dynamically adjust (scale up/down) allocated computing resources by leveraging the vertical elasticity of Docker. The Adaptive Resource Controller periodically adjusts CPU and Memory limits of running containers if necessary, based on the monitored resource usages and pre-defined resource allocation policies.
